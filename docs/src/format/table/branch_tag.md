# Branch and Tag Specification

## Overview

Lance supports branching and tagging for managing multiple independent version histories and creating named references to specific versions.
Branches enable parallel development workflows, while tags provide stable named references for important versions.

## Branching

### Branch Name

Branch names must follow these validation rules:

1. Cannot be empty
2. Cannot start or end with `/`
3. Cannot contain consecutive `//`
4. Cannot contain `..` or `\`
5. Segments must contain only alphanumeric characters, `.`, `-`, `_`
6. Cannot end with `.lock`
7. Cannot be named `main` (reserved for the default branch)

Branch names are case-sensitive, matching Git/GitHub ref semantics. The exact name `main` is a virtual name for the default branch. It may appear in API reference contexts as an alias for the default branch, but no branch metadata file named `main.json` is created.

### Branch Metadata Path

Branch metadata is stored at `_refs/branches/{branch-name}.json` in the dataset root.
Since branch names support hierarchical naming with `/` characters, the `/` is URL-encoded as `%2F` in the filename to distinguish it from directory separators (e.g., `bugfix/issue-123` becomes `bugfix%2Fissue-123.json`):

```
{dataset_root}/
    _refs/
        branches/
            feature-a.json
            bugfix%2Fissue-123.json  # Note: '/' encoded as '%2F'
```

### Branch Metadata File Format

Each branch metadata file is a JSON file with the following fields:

| JSON Key         | Type   | Optional | Description                                                                    |
|------------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `parentBranch`   | string | Yes      | Name of the branch this was created from. `null` indicates branched from the default branch. |
| `parentVersion`  | number |          | Version number of the parent branch at the time this branch was created.       |
| `createAt`       | number |          | Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) when the branch was created.              |
| `manifestSize`   | number |          | Size of the initial manifest file in bytes.                                    |
| `metadata`       | object | Yes      | String key/value metadata map. If absent, it is treated as an empty object.    |

### Branch Dataset Layout

Each branch dataset is technically a [shallow clone](layout.md#shallow-clone) of the source dataset.
Branch datasets are organized using the `tree/` directory at the dataset root:

```
{dataset_root}/
    tree/
        {branch_name}/
            _versions/
                *.manifest
            _transactions/
                *.txn
            _deletions/
                *.arrow
                *.bin
            _indices/
                {UUID}/
                    index.idx
```

Named branches store their version-specific files under `tree/{branch_name}/`, resembling the GitHub branch path convention.
It uses the branch name as is to form the path, 
which means `/` would create a logical subdirectory (e.g., `bugfix/issue-123`, `feature/user-auth`):

```
{dataset_root}/
    tree/
        feature-a/
            _versions/
                1.manifest
                2.manifest
        bugfix/
            issue-123/
                _versions/
                    1.manifest
```

## Tagging

### Tag Name

Tag names must follow these validation rules:

1. Cannot be empty
2. Must contain only alphanumeric characters, `.`, `-`, `_`
3. Cannot start or end with `.`
4. Cannot end with `.lock`
5. Cannot contain consecutive `..`

Note that tag names do not support `/` characters, unlike branch names.

### Tag Storage

Tags are stored as JSON files under `_refs/tags/` at the dataset root:

```
{dataset_root}/
    _refs/
        tags/
            v1.0.0.json
            v1.1.0.json
            production.json
```

Tags are always stored at the root dataset level, regardless of which branch they reference.

### Tag File Format

Each tag file is a JSON file with the following fields:

| JSON Key        | Type   | Optional | Description                                                              |
|-----------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `branch`        | string | Yes      | Branch name being tagged. `null` or absent indicates the default branch. |
| `version`       | number |          | Version number being tagged within that branch.                          |
| `createdAt`     | string | Yes      | RFC 3339 timestamp for when the tag was first created.                  |
| `updatedAt`     | string | Yes      | RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest tag reference update.                 |
| `manifestSize`  | number |          | Size of the manifest file in bytes. Used for efficient manifest loading. |
| `metadata`      | object | Yes      | String key/value metadata map. If absent, it is treated as an empty object. |
